Our team is part of the NIH-funded Rapid Acceleration for Diagnostics (RADx) Tech Clinical Studies Core with Dr. Soni serving as co-PI of the core and study-PI of digital studies under the core. Research produced by our group and Clinical Studies Core has led to several important publications, which contributed to decision-making by federal agencies. Details of specific studies pioneered by our group are included below:

* __Self-Testing for Our Protection from COVID-19__: [STOP COVID-19](https://covid19homestudies.org/stop-covid) study seeks to understand how and why people perform SARS-CoV-2 testing and report their results to the public health department. Participants participate in this study for three months and receive home-delivery of rapid antigen and PCR-collection kits if they report to be at-risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also collect wearable device data from participants to understand if signals from wearable devices can help detect onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 

* __Say Yes! COVID-19 Test Michigan Impact Analysis__: We evaluated the Say Yes! COVID-19 test program in the Washtenaw county of Michigan by closely collaborating with the CareEvolution, LLC, Washtenaw county health department, CDC, and the NIH. Investigation of this program revealed a robust impact of distributing rapid antigen tests at scale with incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in the [intervention community](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.26.22272727v1).

* __Say Yes! COVID-19 Test Digital Assistant Analysis__: We evaluated anonymized data from the SYCT! Digital Assistant to describe reporting behavior of participants for results of rapid-antigen tests to public health departments and itsâ€™ association with incentivization. [We also demonstrated that ordering of rapid-antigen tests was equitable, especially if the ordering portal was made available over a prolonged time period](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.31.22273242v1).

* __Test Us At Home__ and __Test Us At Home Daily__: We performed a largescale study to evaluate performance of rapid antigen tests in comparison to PCR tests. The study was performed in collaboration with the NIH and FDA and led to an [update in guidance from the FDA and CDC about how to use the rapid antigen tests](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/home-covid-19-antigen-tests-take-steps-reduce-your-risk-false-negative-fda-safety-communication).

* __Digital ITAP__: We established a paradigm for rapid evaluation of over-the-counter SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests that can be compared against molecular comparator assays to generate data for [FDA emergency use authorization](https://covid19homestudies.org/itap).
